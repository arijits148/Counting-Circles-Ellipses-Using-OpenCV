# Counting-Circles-and-Ellipses-Using-OpenCV

In this project the number of circles and ellipses has been counted together and then the number of circles has been counted separately. And I have done this project by using blob detection technique and filtering blob.
In computer vision, blob detection methods are aimed at detecting regions in a digital image that differ in properties, such as brightness or color, compared to surrounding regions. Informally, a blob is a region of an image in which some properties are constant or approximately constant; all the points in a blob can be considered in some sense to be similar to each other. The most common method for blob detection is convolution.
